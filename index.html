      <h3><!-- Tagline -->Here is Nicy. And you can know me more in this website.</h3>
      <div id="bannerImage"><img src="island.jpg" alt=""/></div>
      <h2><i>Nice to meet you.</i> </h2>
		<p>As you can see, my name is Nicy. And my Chinese name in Pinyin is <i>Peng Zhi Yuan</i>. If you are an English speaker, you can try to pronounce this: <i>/p'ng/ /'dr/ /ju'an/</i>. I'd like to introduce myself to you with some perspectives. But before that, you should know that, when you want to know somebody, it's not enough to just read his website or blog. Given chances, you are welcome to get along with me in the flesh and know more details about me, which contains not only the appealing points, but also the deadly weakness.</p>

        <h2><a name="C1">Life</a></h2>
        <p>To live is to find something you struggle for happily. Once in a while, I question myself, what's the difference between me, an alive man, and those dead, both of whom will eventually become the dust of history. I don't have any accurate answer, but I think that I've got a direction.</p>
      </aside>
		<h2><i>Manner</i></h2>
		<p>In my daily life, I am pretty enthusiastic to people around me. I am willing to pay my attention to the people in need and try to make efforts to help them. I hold a view that everybody deserves the love that they received just like a child does.</p>		
		
		<h2><i>Habit</i></h2>
		<p><i>To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.</i> I wake up at around 7:30, and have my breakfast earnestly. Sometimes, I will take some deep breaths to relax myself. I never litter. I hardly get mad. I often smile.</p>
		
		<h2><i>Relationship</i></h2>
		<p>I never lack friends. I make my way on being real, and accpet who I am, no matter whether I'm brilliant or terrible. This point brings me a lot of friends who like those who never wear fake masks.</p>
		<p>Moreover, I love my family. I'm from two families, <i>Peng</i> and <i>Zeng</i>. I love my grandparents, who have been raising me since I was born. I have a brother called <i>Zeng Le Shan</i> who is 14 years younger than me. I have a sister called <i>Peng Chu An</i> who is 20 years younger than me. I miss my family members badly when I am far away from them.</p>
		
		<h2><i>Campus</i></h2>
		<p>The time of studying in <a href="https://en.xmu.edu.cn/" style="color:#F28D14" target="_blank"><i>Xiamen University</i></a> is worth memorizing. I like the scenes, the lovely people and the slow life here. I can't help thinking that whether the beauty could last when I'm riding e-motor, rushing down through Qunxian Rd.</p>

        <h2><a name="C2">Moments</a></h2>
        <p>I love fine arts, especially the visual arts. In my spare time, I will go out to take photos. The themes vary from girls to scenes. Kitties are my love as well. With my eyes and my hands, Some memorable occasions are recorded. I hope that these photos could bring touch to people.</p>

		<h2><i>Sunrise in HuangCuo, Xiamen island</i></h2>
	  <p>A buring fire ball is rising. It's like that something dangerous but beautiful is going to come to its birth. The whole world stand up to welcome the sunrise and a brand new day starts.</p>
		<p><hr/></p>
		<p><img src="BlogPostAssets/pan.jpg" width="100%"></p>
		<h2><i>Pan in Shapoway</i></h2>
	  <p>Pan is an active and cute girl. She is a friend of mine. One sunny day she was walking through <i>Shapoway</i> where used to be a bay but now it's been changed into a place of interest. Graffiti is almost around everywhere here.</p>
		<p><hr/></p>
		<p><img src="BlogPostAssets/dong.jpg" width="100%"></p>
		<h2><i>Dong Qing in Xiamen University</i></h2>
		<p>Dong Qing once came to <i>Xiamen University</i> to interview Pan maoyuan. She is about 50 years old, but it seems like that time is unable to hurt her. She is beautiful and elegant still. When she smiles, everyone feels like that the spring wind was travelling around them and mildly touched them.</p>

		<p><img src="BlogPostAssets/moon.jpg" width="100%"></p>
		<h2><i>Song'en Bd. and the full moon</i></h2>
		<p>It was taken on the Mid-Autumn festival. At that time, I was far away from my hometown and family. Thinking that my family was celebrating the festival but I was alone, I felt sorrow. What makes scenes meaningful is not the scenes themselves but the mood you feel when you are in the scenes.</p>

		<h2><a name="C3">Story</a></h2>
