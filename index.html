		This website will be updated weekly. <br>
		Before reading, you might need to know: <br>
		You should know that this website is just about ME. There is no pressure or bad things here. It's pure. So probably there will be something that is different from the objective facts.

      <h2><i>Nice to meet you.</i> </h2>
		<p>As you can see, my name is Nicy. And my Chinese name in Pinyin is <i>Peng Zhi Yuan</i>. If you are an English speaker, you can try to pronounce this: <i>/p'ng/ /'dr/ /ju'an/</i>. I'd like to introduce myself to you with some perspectives. But before that, you should know that, when you want to know somebody, it's not enough to just read his website or blog. Given chances, you are welcome to get along with me in the flesh and know more details about me, which contains not only the appealing points, but also the deadly weakness.</p>

        <h2><a name="C1">Life</a></h2>
        <p>To live is to find something you struggle for happily. Once in a while, I question myself, what's the difference between me, an alive man, and those dead, both of whom will eventually become the dust of history. I don't have any accurate answer, but I think that I've got a direction.</p>
      </aside>
		<h2><i>Manner</i></h2>
		<p>In my daily life, I am pretty enthusiastic to people around me. I am willing to pay my attention to the people in need and try to make efforts to help them. I hold a view that everybody deserves the love that they received just like a child does. <br>
		I always pay attention to what deserves my attentions. There is no waste of time in my life. I hold a firm view that my life is not to be wasted and I should make use of it. Otherwise, there is nothing different between me and those dead. <br>
	  However, it doesn't mean that I never have fun or relax myself. In my spare time, I do the things I'm interested in. I will relax myself by painting or listening to music.To tell you the truth, I am a firm fans of Nintendo. I love palying <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i>. Laughing and sharing my love with my friends are also necessary. If you find the meaning in the time you spent, then the time could be your so-called <span style="font-weight: bold">life</span>.</p>		
		
		<h2><i>Habit</i></h2>
		<p><i>To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.</i> I wake up at around 7:30, and have my breakfast earnestly. Sometimes, I will take some deep breaths to relax myself. I never litter. I hardly get mad. I often smile. <br>
	  I like to have seafood. And my favorite drink is <i>Eastern Leaf</i>. Actually, I like all kinds of tea, even thought some of them is unbearably bitter and astringent. The truth is, I enjoy foods, becauese all of them are the presents given by nature.</p>
		
		<h2><i>Relationship</i></h2>
		<p>I never lack friends. I make my way on being real, and accept who I am, no matter whether I'm brilliant or terrible. This point brings me a lot of friends who like those who never wear fake masks.</p>
		<p>Moreover, I love my family. I'm from two families, <i>Peng</i> and <i>Zeng</i>. I love my grandparents, who have been raising me since I was born. I have a brother called <i>Zeng Le Shan</i> who is 14 years younger than me. I have a sister called <i>Peng Chu An</i> who is 20 years younger than me. I miss my family members badly when I am far away from them.</p>
		
		<h2><i>Campus</i></h2>
		<p>The time of studying in <a href="https://en.xmu.edu.cn/" style="color:#F28D14" target="_blank"><i>Xiamen University</i></a> is worth memorizing. I like the scenes, the lovely people and the slow life here. I can't help thinking that whether the beauty could last when I'm riding e-motor, rushing down through Qunxian Rd. <br>
		Living in <i>Xiamen University</i> will be an unforgettable memory in my life. Here I make my best friends and leave my footmark. When I first came here, I was just a childish boy, fantasying some impractical affairs. Hammered and inspired by the real life, I get to find my position in this world. I still believe that the dignity of human beings, beauty in hearts and kindness between people truly exist. Looking for them and Spreading them will become my life-long career.
	  This is what <i>Xiamen University</i> taught me. As the motto saying, <i>Self improve until we die, Great love is our destination.</i> </p>

        <h2><a name="C2">Moments</a></h2>
        <p>I love fine arts, especially the visual arts. In my spare time, I will go out to take photos. The themes vary from girls to scenes. Kitties are my love as well. With my eyes and my hands, Some memorable occasions are recorded. I hope that these photos could bring touch to people.</p>

		<h2><i>Sunrise in HuangCuo, Xiamen island</i></h2>
	  <p>A buring fire ball is rising. It's like that something dangerous but beautiful is going to come to its birth. The whole world stand up to welcome the sunrise and a brand new day starts.</p>

		<h2><i>Pan in Shapoway</i></h2>
	  <p>Pan is an active and cute girl. She is a friend of mine. One sunny day she was walking through <i>Shapoway</i> where used to be a bay but now it's been changed into a place of interest. Graffiti is almost around everywhere here.</p>

		<h2><i>Dong Qing in Xiamen University</i></h2>
		<p>Dong Qing once came to <i>Xiamen University</i> to interview Pan maoyuan. She is about 50 years old, but it seems like that time is unable to hurt her. She is beautiful and elegant still. When she smiles, everyone feels like that the spring wind was travelling around them and mildly touched them.</p>

		<h2><i>Song'en Bd. and the full moon</i></h2>
		<p>It was taken on the Mid-Autumn festival. At that time, I was far away from my hometown and family. Thinking that my family was celebrating the festival but I was alone, I felt sorrow. What makes scenes meaningful is not the scenes themselves but the mood you feel when you are in the scenes.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Cambria, 'Hoefler Text', 'Liberation Serif', Times, 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; color: white; font-size: 16px ; line-height: 26px">Are you interested in what I prefer? <br> Music is a vital part in my life. Taylor Swift, QUEEN, Ed sheeran, Macklemore and the background music of <i>Animal Crossing</i> occupy almost all of my song list. <br>Don't forget films. The most impressive movie is <i>Blade Runner: 2049</i> directed by <i>Philip.K.Dick</i> and <i>Hampton Fancher</i>. Moreover, <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> and <i>Persuit of Happyness</i> are also interesting. If you have time, you should try them. <br>
		And I said that I am a game lover. <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i> grabbed my heart at my first sight. It helps me think of what we are chasing as we come to the world. <i>Legend of Zelda</i> also has a kind of magic. The two ones always make me happy. I love them!

		<p style="font-family: Microsoft JhengHei; color: white; font-size: 16px ; line-height: 26px">
		 如果你是一位汉语母语者，我想你已经注意到了一些问题。在一些内容的中英互译上，我做出了一些值得品味的行为。 <br>
		  例如，在<i>生活 </i>的<i>校园 </i>标签里，我提到了我的<i>厦门大学 </i>的校训，“自强不息，止于至善。”在思考如何翻译“至善”时，我花了一点时间。 <br>
		  如果我们想要翻译某句古语，首先要自己先明白，简洁的话语背后蕴藏了什么含义。为什么要追求“至善”？“至善”的真正含义又是什么？在向自己抛出着两个问题后，我尝试用一些宋明理学的角度来回答这个问题。我们中国人，无论面对多么残酷的生存环境，都是有向心力的。我们会站在整个民族乃至整个人类的角度去思考某些问题。理学家的恢弘气势可以说是古代中国的“胸怀宇宙苍生”心态的巅峰了。这是一种不可磨灭的文化传统：最大的善，是指向整个民族群体的。我顿悟到，我们挂在嘴边的“至善”，不是帮人做了什么事情，扶了老奶奶过马路，就止步了。而是把我们的事业和胸襟扩展到整个群体的高度去。通俗的讲，就是“大爱”。于是，我将它翻译成了“<i>Great Love</i>”。 <br>这是十分有趣的。同样的，在翻译“为天地立心”时，我也费了一番周章。翻译成英语，是为了让说英语的人理解我们想表达的意思。可是，西方人该如何懂这一个简单的“心”字？如今被城市化的中国孩子们尚且认为晦涩难懂，遑论与我们文化传统迥然相异的西方人了。于是便将简短的五个字掰开了说，揉碎了说。“为天地立心”，可天地如何有心？天地本就是无情物罢了，即便为其立一本不存在之心，也使人摸不着头脑。但是，“天地”一词，实为虚指。它真正的含义，是这天地所包纳的有灵之物。为何要为天地立心？其实是凸显自己作为天地间的有灵之物，立下有灵之物的尊严，和我们中国文人经常强调的一字，“格”，有着一定的关系。用西方人易于了解的概念来讲的话，可以说是“人类的尊严”。为了树立这尊严，我们需要向天地、祖先、后代，向他们昭示，人类在这天地间的出现，并不是完全无意义的自然选择和环境演化。我们如何证明自己来过？如何让我们的星球在群星之中因我们的出现而不同？那么，其中一种方法，就是上一段提到的，“至善”。人类的渺小，是像苇草一般的脆弱。但是人类的伟大，却是充盈整个寰宇的胸襟。多少风流事，引后世赓歌，都是出于这个原因。那么这“至善”，为何翻译成了“仁慈”呢？因为我认为，横渠四句还想强调一个事情，就是强调个体，也就是强调发出宏伟气魄的那个人。“仁慈”往往是有对象的，既有发出对象，又有接收对象。而“大爱”是一种群体性的追求，虽不能完全达到，却是一个十分值得前进的方向，偏强调那些被大爱惠及的人，也就是接收对象。而翻译成仁慈，则是想强调个体性，强调这种由个体生发出的历史责任感的难能可贵。 <br>
		  汉语富有的美感与有趣的地方，也是我深深爱上它的原因之一。</p>
